Mugo Object Relations version 1.0
#################################
The following features need to be added to the mugo object relations extension,
in future versions:
    1) Extendable Cross Reference Data - The extension needs to be "Extendable"
    in terms of the metadata field: to start, you would want to have a custom display label,
    to support a dropdown list of options, and to support more than one metadata field.
    These elements should be configurable at the content class attribute level;
    in other words, editable per each use in a class, but common for all content
    objects of that class.

    2) EZFind support - The attribute needs to be searchable.  In other words,
    both the object relation metadata value and the name of the related object
    would end up being part of the source object's search metadata.  This needs
    to apply to the eZ Find search (it already applies to the native eZ Publish
    search).
